      <h3>Student</h3>
      <p>
        I am a co-terminal student at Illinois Institute of Technology. I
        started my B.S. Applied Cybersecurity and Information Technology in
        August 2019 and will complete it in May 2023. I will be starting my
        Master of Cyber Forensics and Security in January 2021 and will complete
        it in the same year as my bachelor's.
      </p>
      <h3>Developer</h3>
      <p>
        I have been doing development work since the 7th grade. I started out
        with writing Minecraft server plugins in Java, and have expanded my
        skills since then. While Java is the language I am most comfortable
        with, I am also experienced in Python and JavaScript, and also have
        used some C++. I have taken courses at IIT to prepare me for the
        CompTIA A+, Network+, and Linux+ exams, and I am currently taking
        futher training courses in order to get my Network+ certification.
